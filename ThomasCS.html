<p>Hi my name is Thomas Ramsey and this is basically my first year fully going through with wrestling,and what i mean by that is when i was in my fresh i tried to do wrestling but sadly i had to quit so i made a promise to myself to do better next time and i did.It begin my junior year of wrestling season when i was tempted to join but i didn't so i just went the week after it first started . During that week i started I ain't gone lie it was hard and i did feel like giving up but i had to remember the promise i made to mysel to do better so i pushed myself daily just to go to pratice and be more than what i was. So as time went on i was still there just pushing and i noticed that i had a big goal i now want to reach and it is to go state for wrestling and be apart of east's history. I did miss a couple meets but not too many but i still kept pushing because i now knew what i had to do to succeed. most of my meets were tiring but with me having the thoughtt, the mentality to push foward and win i ended up winning most of my matches.I finnished my season with the record of 11 wins and 7 losses which is not bad at all considering this was basically my first time actually staying in something and finnishing it through well besides football but besides that i did good as far as reaching my goal.I almost won state for te weight class of 195 and i won some medals during my season, and even if i did lose that last match to go state 'm just happy at the fac that i made it that far im y season.</p>
