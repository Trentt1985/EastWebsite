            <h3>The beautiful Torres del Paine National Park is one of Chile's most important natural sites and a growingly popular tourist destination. This wonderfully gorgeous location, located more than 100 kilometers North of the city of Puerto Natales in southern Patagonia, comprises mountains, glaciers, and innumerable lakes and rivers. The Cordillera del Paine is the park's most important region, marking the transition from the Patagonia grassland to the northern subpolar forests. The three 2,850-meter-tall granite peaks of the Paine Massif, which dominate this already spectacular terrain, are perhaps the most prominent of its many wonderful features. Hiking is one of the most popular activities in the park, with numerous well-marked paths and many offering overnight shelters (refugios) with the essentials for longer excursions around the mountains. Professional guides are suggested and, in certain locations, required if you plan on hiking for more than a day. The five-day W Trek, one of Patagonia's best hikes, is one of the park's most popular guided tours. The huge Glacier Grey and the mountains of Paine Grande are among the highlights of this 71-kilometer trek through Patagonia.</h3>

            <h3>Bora Bora is a dormant volcano island situated on one of the world's most gorgeous and crystal-clear lagoons, which are colored in a million different shades of blue. Bora Bora is about a 50-minute flight away from the islands of Tahiti and Moorea. For those wishing to island hop, Air Tahiti offers flights to Bora Bora every 50 minutes from Papeete and Moorea. There are no better places to immerse oneself in the natural ambiance of Bora Bora than on the island's beaches. The famed Bora Bora resorts, which feature Polynesian spas, gourmet restaurants, overwater bungalows, villas, and suites all in one spot, are home to many of the magnificent beaches.</h3>

            <h3>On the Zambezi River, which forms the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe, Victoria Falls is a breathtaking sight of awe-inspiring majesty and grandeur. 'Mosi-oa-Tunya' – 'The Smoke that Thunders' – was the name given to it by the Kololo tribe who lived in the area in the 1800s. In today's words, Victoria Falls is known as the world's largest curtain of cascading water.
 More than 500 million cubic meters of water every minute plummets over the edge, over a breadth of about two kilometers, into a gorge over one hundred meters below, creating columns of spray visible from miles away during the rainy season.</h3>
